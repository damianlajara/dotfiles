# Dotfiles
Alot of big configurations comes in small packages :D

## Steps to config
* Clone and extract files into your home dir
* Download iterm2
* Install Zsh (Check with zsh --version since you probably already have it :p)
* Install [Oh-My-Zsh](sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)")
* Install all these [iTerm themes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes). You can never go wrong with more style!
* Install all these [fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts). My favorite to use is Meslo
* Go to your iTerm font settings and make sure you change the font (both regular and non-ascii) to your new powerline font of choice
* Install tmux: `brew install tmux`
* Optional - Install tmuxinator `gem install tmuxinator`
* And you're done!
* Always remember: Iterm + vim + tmux + style = Love!
