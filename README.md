# Dotfiles
Big configurations come in small packages :D

## Steps to config
* Clone and extract files into your home dir
* Download iterm2
* Install Zsh (Check with zsh --version since you probably already have it :p)
* Install [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
* Download all these [iTerm themes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes). You can never go wrong with more style!
* Install all these [fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) on your system. My favorite to use is Meslo
* Go to your iTerm font settings and make sure you change the font (both regular and non-ascii) to your new powerline font of choice
* Go to your iTerm color/theme settings and import all of the themes you just downloaded
* Install searching tool Ag (A.K.A "the silver searcher"): `brew install the_silver_searcher`
* Install tmux: `brew install tmux`
* Optional - Install tmuxinator `gem install tmuxinator`
* And you're done!
* Always remember: Iterm + vim + tmux + style = Love!
